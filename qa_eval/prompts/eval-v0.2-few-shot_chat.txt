Provide an explanation for the comparison and give your judgment with a "yes" or "no" in a new line. Here, "yes" represents that the candidate answer is relevant and correct or partially correct based on either inbuilt knowledge or ground-truth answers. If not, the judgment based on the explanation should be "no".
